1. RELATIONAL OPERATORS & BUSINESS RULE VALIDATION – NOTES

Stock Availability
Rule: A product can be added to the cart only if stock is more than zero.
Relational Operator Used: >
Condition:
stock > 0

Explanation:
Using > ensures only positive stock values are allowed. Checking != 0 is unsafe because it allows negative stock values, which are invalid.

2. Quantity Limit per Order
Rule: A customer can purchase a maximum of 5 units of a product.
Relational Operator Used: <=
Condition:
quantity <= 5

Explanation:
This allows quantities from 1 to 5 and prevents purchasing more than 5 units. Using < 5 would wrongly reject quantity 5.

3. Payment Verification
Rule: Order is confirmed only if paid amount exactly matches the order amount.
Relational Operator Used: ==
Condition:
paid_amount == order_amount

Issue with Floating-Point Values:
Floating-point numbers may have precision errors. Two values that appear equal may not be exactly equal in memory, which can cause valid payments to be rejected.

4. Fraud Detection Check
Rule: An order is flagged if the order amount is greater than the average order value.
Relational Operator Used: >
Condition:
order_amount > average_order_value

Explanation:
This condition alone does not guarantee fraud detection because genuine customers can also place high-value orders. Fraud detection requires multiple checks.

Return Policy Validation
Rule: A product can be returned only within 7 days of delivery.
Relational Operator Used: <=
Condition:
days_since_delivery <= 7

5. Boundary Issue:
Using < 7 rejects returns on the 7th day. Using >= 7 allows late returns. This is called an off-by-one error.

Wishlist Limit
Rule: A user can add items only until the wishlist contains fewer than 100 products.
Relational Operator Used: <
Condition:
wishlist_count < 100

Explanation:
This blocks adding items when the count reaches 100. Using <= 100 would allow 101 items, violating the rule.

6. Free Delivery Rule
Rule: Free delivery is applicable when cart value is 499 or more.
Relational Operator Used: >=
Condition:
cart_value >= 499

Boundary Case:
If cart value is exactly 499, free delivery is applied. Using > would wrongly reject 499.

Discount Eligibility
Rule: Discount is applied only if cart value is above 2000.
Relational Operator Used: >
Condition:
cart_value > 2000

7. Business Logic Issue:
Using >= 2000 would apply discount at exactly 2000, which violates the rule “above 2000”.

Coupon Expiry Validation
Rule: Coupon is valid until the expiry date (inclusive).
Relational Operator Used: <=
Condition:
current_date <= expiry_date

Boundary Issue:
Using < rejects the coupon on the expiry date. Using > allows expired coupons.

8. Loan Tenure Meaning
Loan tenure is the total time period for which the loan is taken.

Tenure Usage:
Simple Interest – Years
EMI Calculation – Months

Example:
5 years = 60 months (for EMI)

Loan Calculation (Simple Interest)
Given:
Principal (P) = 75,00,000
Rate (R) = 19%
Time (T) = 5 years

Formula:
SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Calculation:
SI = 71,25,000
Total Amount Payable = 1,46,25,000



10. Java Program – Character Check Using Ternary Operator

import java.util.Scanner;

public class CharacterCheck {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        char ch = sc.next().charAt(0);

        String result =
            (ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z') || (ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z') ?
                "Alphabet" :
            (ch >= '0' && ch <= '9') ?
                "Number" :
                "Special Character";

        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
