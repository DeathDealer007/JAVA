# PAGE 1 — INTRODUCTION, WORKING & STRUCTURE

### Q1. What is Java?

Java is a **high-level, object-oriented programming language** used to develop secure, robust, and portable software applications. Java source code is written in high-level language and converted into machine-understandable form for execution.

---

### Q2. How does Java work internally?

Java follows a **hybrid model (compiler + interpreter)**.

**Working Flow:**

```
.java file → javac (compiler) → .class (bytecode) → JVM → Machine Code
```

* `javac` compiles source code into **bytecode**
* JVM executes bytecode using **Interpreter + JIT compiler**

---

### Q3. What is JVM, JRE, and JDK?

* **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**
  Executes bytecode, provides platform independence, memory management, security, and performance optimization.

* **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**
  Contains JVM + core libraries required to run Java programs.

* **JDK (Java Development Kit)**
  Contains JRE + development tools like compiler (`javac`), debugger, etc.

📌 **Relation:**

```
JDK → JRE → JVM
```

---

### Q4. How does Java achieve platform independence?

Java programs are compiled into **platform-independent bytecode**.
Each OS has its own JVM which converts bytecode into machine code.

➡️ Hence: **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)**

---

### Q5. What is the basic structure of a Java program?

```java
class ClassName {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // program statements
    }
}
```

* `class` → blueprint
* `main()` → entry point
* `public static void main` → required for JVM execution

# PAGE 2 — TOKENS, DATA TYPES & VARIABLES

### Q6. What are tokens in Java?

Tokens are the **smallest units** of a Java program.

---

### Q7. Types of Tokens in Java

1. **Keywords**
   Reserved words (e.g., `class`, `static`, `int`)

2. **Identifiers**
   Names given by programmer (class, method, variable names)

3. **Literals**
   Fixed values:

   * Integer: `10`
   * Float: `10.5f`
   * Character: `'a'` (single character)
   * String: `"Java"` (group of characters)
   * Boolean: `true`, `false`

4. **Separators**

   * `{}` → blocks
   * `()` → methods/conditions
   * `;` → end of statement
   * `.` → reference
   * `,` → separates variables

---

### Q8. What are data types in Java?

Data types specify **what type of data a variable can store**.

---

### Q9. Types of Data Types

#### Primitive (Inbuilt):

* `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`
* `float`, `double`
* `char`
* `boolean`

#### Non-Primitive (User-defined):

* `String`
* Arrays
* Classes

---

### Q10. What are variables?

Variables are **memory locations** used to store data.

**Declaration & Initialization:**

```java
datatype variable = value;
```

---

### Q11. Types of Variables

* **Local Variable** → declared inside methods
* **Static Variable** → declared using `static`, shared by all objects
* **Global (Class-level) Variable** → accessible throughout the class

---

# PAGE 3 — OPERATORS, COMPILER VS INTERPRETER

### Q12. What are operators in Java?

Operators are symbols used to **perform operations on operands**.

---

### Q13. Unary Operators

Operate on **one operand**.

Examples:

* `++`, `--`
* `!`
* `new`

```java
int a = 5;
a++;   // post-increment
++a;   // pre-increment
```

---

### Q14. Binary Operators

Operate on **two operands**.

Types:

* Arithmetic: `+ - * / %`
* Relational: `> < == !=`
* Logical: `&& ||`

---

### Q15. Ternary Operator

Only operator with **three operands**.

```java
condition ? value1 : value2;
```

---

### Q16. Difference between Compiler and Interpreter

| Feature       | Compiler          | Interpreter   |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| Translation   | Whole program     | Line by line  |
| Speed         | Faster            | Slower        |
| Error display | After compilation | One at a time |
| Output file   | Yes               | No            |

📌 Java uses **both**:

* `javac` → compiler
* JVM → interpreter + JIT

---

### Q17. Is an interpreter a compiler?

❌ No.
Both are translators but work differently.
